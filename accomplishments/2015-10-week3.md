### Week in Review

Hey! This week I got a little bit sidetracked but it was for good! I coulnd't code as much as I wanted to but I went to a party, I voted and
I even got scheduled a job interview!!! I watched a couple of videos and read about Wordpress and a payment API I need to apply to a new site I'm working on
so that seems on track :)! I got a pair of new nice bow ties and they go great with my new suit so watch out ;)! I also rescued an old notebook
from my grandma's house...it was "broken" but nothing is impossible you know ;)! I fixed it and installed Debian on it so I was a little bit busy
trying to learn how to use it. I found another broken (this time for real) computear so I grabbed the functional parts (ram, hdd) and installed them in
the revived notebook! I signed up for a new course about full stack development and I needed to bring a laptop so now I'm ready to rock :D!!!
