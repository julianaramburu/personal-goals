This month was the third one I've been learning how to code and most important, it's been the third one since I've changed for ever!
So I've been under a little bit of turbulence in the last couples of weeks because even if I've changed...it's still hard to cope with everything!
To cope with the idea that you can be whatever you want or with the idea and realization that you can accomplish everything you propose and want to.
So this "monthly things I'll do" list got a little bit sidetracked because of that but this isn't a failure by no meas! So be ready November :D! Here I come!
