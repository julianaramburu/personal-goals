### Week in Review

This was my very first week trying this open source goal list. It came out pretty well since I was abel to tackle almost every listed item from it so I'm happy about it :D! 
I read some articles about JS Closures but I think I need more testing and coding to graps the idea better. I also watched several conferences videos and TED talks about topics like CSS, Learning and Job interviews so it also was very productive.
I need to get myself down to coding a little bit more since I was a little bit sloppy with that and I think it's one of the cores of my weekly goals.
